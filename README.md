# Deployment and Demo

# Wireframe

The wireframe was designed using [Wireframe.cc]( https://wireframe.cc/) links to the original version can be found below:

# UX

I have opted for a simple design that I feel gets the information to the client effectively and directs them to the areas that they need to go.

- Home page: Contains all the company contact information along with a hero image, company location map, opening hours and a contact form.
- About us page: Contains an introduction to the company including year established etc. This also contains profiles of the Management team to let the client get familiar with the company.
- Services page: Contains information on the various services offered by the company with a button to link to the contact page.
- contact page: Contact page contains a contact form and also clickable phone number and email address.

In order to improve user experience and website loading speed, I have compressed the images using [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) and the reduction in image size has been 68%.

# Testing

Website has been tested using [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/nfox13.github.io/PoOnnUXq) see results below:

![Website Speed Test Results](assets/images/speed_test.jpg)

When I initially deployed the website, all my navbar links were returning a 404 message. I had used a relative path through the folders as opposed to services.html etc

Some of my images were not displaying when I used the img tag so I changed these to an anchor tag and they worked perfectly

To improve on the results I could work on the scaled images and also the browser caching

HTML and CSS has been tested using W3C validator and Jigsaw validator
