# UX

I have opted for a simple design that I feel gets the information to the client effectively and directs them to the areas that they need to go.

- Home page: Contains all the company contact information along with a hero image, company location map, opening hours and a contact form.
- About us page: Contains an introduction to the company including year established etc. This also contains profiles of the Management team to let the client get familiar with the company.
- Services page: Contains information on the various services offered by the company with a button to link to the contact page.
- contact page: Contact page contains a contact form and also clickable phone number and email address.
